# volunteer_backend

This is my Mod 5 final projet for Flatiron school called Volunteer.

Why people volunteer?
The benefits of volunteering can be enormous. Volunteering offers vital help to people in need, and the community, find new friends  and opportunities to learn new skills. In general, it can help those in need and improve your health and happiness.
This App helps  to find volunteer opportunities as well as look for volunteers for your event.  - Volunteering has never been easier. Welcome to Volunteer App!
