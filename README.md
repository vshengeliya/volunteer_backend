# volunteer_backend

This is my Mod 5 final projet for Flatiron school. 
This App Volunteer was build with Ruby on Rails for backend. To turn on the server:

 -  cd into the folder volunteer_backend
 - run `rails db:create db:migrate` - to create a Data Base and migrte the tables
 - run `rails db:seed` - to seed the created data
 - run `bundle install` - to install and update all the Gems
 - run `rails s` - to turn on the server
